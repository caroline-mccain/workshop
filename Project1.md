# Project 1: Mongolia

## Part 1: Adminstrative Subdivisions
The purpose of this part was to create a map with the adminstrative subdivisions of our selected Lower Middle Income Country. In Mongolia, the first level of subdivision is the province, and on my map they are labeled in yellow. The lower level is the district level, and these are represented in red. My biggest difficultly with this step of the project was ordering the layers correctly to have colors appear. Since in the next step I would have to subdivide the country and focus on one region, Khovsgol, I included a map of the districts of this province.
