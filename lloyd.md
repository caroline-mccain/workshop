The datasets used by these authors are used to map development data onto a geographic representation. These datasets and grid representations of the world will only become more important as world population continues to grow. These grid cells first pull population data from the appropriate census. This data is originally grouped by administrative areas determined by the census, but are broken down into the grid cells. Then, other layers of data are aggregated. These other layers can relate to geography, precipitation, water bodies, and anything else that is viewed as relevant to the problems under study. Most of this data comes from satellite imagery. Using these gridded interpretations of data has important applications in terms of international aid. When just using census data, aid is distributed to wider areas and may not help those that need it the most. However, when gridded cells are used, data can be more targeted to the areas that need it the most. This makes the aid process more effective and efficient. In particular, these authors use a wide variety of data sets to create a high resolution depiction of the world. By effectively combining resources from GADM and WorldPop, among others, the data used can provide a variety of details relevant to developement discussions.
